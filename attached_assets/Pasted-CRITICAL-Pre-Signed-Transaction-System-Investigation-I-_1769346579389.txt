CRITICAL: Pre-Signed Transaction System Investigation

I just realized something important: BEFORE the mainnet migration work we did today, I HAD pre-signed transactions working. The system was creating PSBTs during loan setup for:
- REPAYMENT transaction
- DEFAULT_LIQUIDATION transaction  
- BORROWER_RECOVERY transaction

But you just told me these DON'T exist. This means either:
1. The migration process broke/removed this functionality
2. You're looking at the wrong code
3. The code exists but isn't being used

URGENT INVESTIGATION REQUIRED:

PART 1: Search for Pre-Signed Transaction Code

Search the ENTIRE codebase for:
- "cooperative" or "cooperativeClose"
- "repayment" (in PSBT context, not just loan status)
- "recovery" or "borrowerRecovery"
- "defaultLiquidation" or "liquidation"
- "presigned" or "pre-signed" or "preSigned"
- PSBT storage or serialization
- Any code that creates PSBTs during loan SETUP (not during release)

PART 2: Check Database Schema

Look for these columns in the loans table:
- tx_cooperative_close_hex
- tx_default_hex
- tx_liquidation_hex
- tx_cancellation_hex
- tx_recovery_hex
- tx_under_review_hex
- tx_repayment_hex

Do these columns EXIST in the database? If yes, are they being USED?

PART 3: Check for Transaction Template Services

Search for files like:
- TransactionTemplateService
- PsbtBuilder or PSBTBuilder
- TransactionBuilder
- Any service that creates transaction templates

Show me:
- File paths
- What these services do
- Are they being called during loan creation?

PART 4: Check Git History

Look at recent commits (last 2 days):
- Were any files related to pre-signed transactions deleted?
- Were any services renamed or refactored?
- Did we accidentally remove functionality during the mainnet migration?

PART 5: Find Where Loans Are Created

Show me the COMPLETE loan creation flow:
- POST /api/loans endpoint code
- What services are called?
- Are PSBTs created during this process?
- Where are they stored?

PART 6: Compare Working vs Current State

If you find the pre-signed transaction code:
- Is it still being executed?
- Did something in our migration disable it?
- Can we re-enable it?

CRITICAL: If we broke working functionality during migration, we need to RESTORE it immediately. The user HAD a working non-custodial system with borrower recovery paths, and now it might be broken.

Search thoroughly and report EVERYTHING you find related to pre-signed transactions.
