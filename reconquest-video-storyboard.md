## SCENE 1: The Problem (0:00 - 0:20)

**VISUAL:** Draw a person holding a Bitcoin symbol, looking worried. Draw a thought bubble showing a house, car, or business opportunity.

## SCENE 2: What Are Bitcoin-Backed Assets? (0:20 - 0:55)

**VISUAL:** Draw a house with a price tag, then draw a bank giving money to a person, with an arrow pointing back to the house labeled "collateral."

**NARRATION:**
"First, let's understand a powerful concept: asset-backed lending. When you buy a house, the bank gives you a mortgage. The house itself is the collateral – your guarantee that you'll repay."

**VISUAL ELEMENTS:**
- House with price tag
- Bank building with money flowing out
- Arrow connecting house to loan (labeled "Collateral")
- Checkmark showing security

**VISUAL:** Transform the house into a glowing Bitcoin symbol. Draw the same flow – Bitcoin as collateral, cash flowing to person.

**NARRATION:**
"Now imagine the same thing, but with Bitcoin. Your Bitcoin becomes the collateral. You get cash today, and when you repay, you get your Bitcoin back. This is a Bitcoin-backed loan."

**VISUAL ELEMENTS:**
- House morphing into Bitcoin symbol
- Same collateral flow diagram
- "Bitcoin-Backed Loan" text appearing

**VISUAL:** Draw comparison: traditional assets (house, gold bars, stocks) on one side, Bitcoin on the other with checkmarks.

**NARRATION:**
"Bitcoin is the perfect collateral. It's globally recognized, instantly verifiable, available 24/7, and can be securely locked without any paperwork. No lawyers. No lengthy approvals. Just math and code."

**VISUAL ELEMENTS:**
- Traditional assets: house, gold bar, stock certificate (with slow/complex icons)
- Bitcoin with checkmarks: "Global," "Instant," "24/7," "Secure"
- Speed comparison (turtle vs rocket)

## SCENE 3: Introducing Reconquest (0:55 - 1:10)

"Browse loan requests, choose the returns you want, and fund loans with regular bank transfers. The borrower's Bitcoin serves as your security."

**VISUAL:** Draw lender browsing offers on screen, selecting one, bank transfer arrow

"If the borrower repays on time, you earn interest. If they don't, you're protected by the Bitcoin collateral. It's lending with a safety net."

**VISUAL:** Draw two paths: happy path (money + interest returning), protected path (shield with Bitcoin)

**VISUAL ELEMENTS:**
